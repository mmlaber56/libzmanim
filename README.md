# Libzmanim

a C library for zmanim and hebrew dates

a port of [KosherJava/Zmanim](https://github.com/KosherJava/zmanim) developed by Eliyahu Hershfeld. [https://kosherjava.com](https://kosherjava.com)

## Installation

run ` make` to build the library (shared and static) in the lib folder.

run `make test` to build a test wrapper (in the test folder) to display the daily zmanim.

this creates a shared and static library that can be used by including the header files in `include` and linking with `-lzmanim` (you must add the library and headers to your `PATH`)

### Windows

run window.bat in a VisualStudio command prompt to build `libzmanim.dll` and `test.exe`. This uses the OpenBSD stpncpy.

## Usage

this library has a new struct `hdate` which is like `struct tm` used to store a date instance in the hebrew calendar.

one can initialize the members directly or use the `hdate convertDate(struct tm date)` function to convert a gregorian date, along with other functions in `hebrewcalendar.c` to manipulate it or get yomtov parshah etc.

for more documentation read the header files.

to format the date in hebrew use the functions in `hdateformat.h`.

one can then use this `hdate` along with the `location` struct (lat, long, elevation) in one of the getzmanim functions in `zmanim.h` that return a `hdate` with the correct zman.

for further examples see the test.c file that implements a basic wrapper to show daily zmanim

### Test usage
